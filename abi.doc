The va_list type

The va_list type is an array containing a single element of one structure
containing the necessary information to implement the va_arg macro. The C
definition of va_list type is:

typedef struct {
	unsigned int gp_offset;
	unsigned int fp_offset;
	void *overflow_arg_area;
	void *reg_save_area;
} va_list[1];

The va_start Macro

The va_start macro initializes the structure as follows:

reg_save_area
The element points to the start of the register save area.

overflow_arg_area
	This pointer is used to fetch arguments passed on the stack.  It is
	initialized with the address of the first argument passed on the stack, if
	any, and then always updated to point to the start of the next argument on
	the stack.

gp_offset
	The element holds the offset in bytes from reg_save_area to the place where
	the next available general purpose argument register is saved. In case all
	argument registers have been exhausted, it is set to the value 48 (6 * 8).

fp_offset
	The element holds the offset in bytes from reg_save_area to the place where
	the next available floating point argument register is saved. In case all
	argument registers have been exhausted, it is set to the value 304 (6 * 8 +
	16 * 16).
